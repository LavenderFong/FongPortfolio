<h3>Ocean Wave</h3>
<h4>May 2025</h4>
<p>"Before starting on this project, I knew I wanted to do a purple color scheme with stars and hearts hidden in plain sight. As I was creating this piece, I wanted to make it a bit more whimsical because that is what it was feeling like with hidden stars and hearts, so I added chimes to the ambience. "</p>

<h3>Macaron The Crow</h3>
<h4>Feburary 2025</h4>
<p>"I wanted to create a cute little animation that just had an animal during animal things, so I chose a crow. Crows are one of my favorite animals because they are very intelligent, and they love to collect trinkets. 
This is the first animation where all the special effects I created in my room. The ruffling sound was me moving my hands in a fake flower, the CLOP sound, from the beak, is just me clapping, then the flapping sound is from a dress I own. The background ambience noises are from two separate free sound clips I found online.

<h3>Buddy Meets a Buddy</h3>
<h4>December 2024</h4>
<p>"TThis was my first major Blender project, where me and two other hardworking animators combined 2d and 3d to make this animation. I really learned about the process of teamwork in animation, sharing files, communication, and deadlines. I couldnâ€™t ask for a better team."</p>
